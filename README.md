# LANL-Postdoc-Graph-Theory-UQ

Python code for UQ in natural gas production for LANL postdoc

DFNWorks is a Python based wrapper for simulating flow and tranport in discrete fracture networks

It has an extension which invokes graph theory to simulate flow and transport through graph representation of the discrete fracture networks

Code fragments with contributions from Saumik are clearly written as "saumik added..."

Modified dfn2graph.py, graph_flow.py and graph_transport.py

Wrote remaining python files for post processing the results
